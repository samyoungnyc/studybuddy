studybuddy
==========

This was my first deep dive into iOS and Objective-C. Study Buddy is a project I started to build for a Columbia student. 
The purpose of Study Buddy was to make it easy for college students to create study groups through the app.
When the student failed to live up to our contractual terms, I stopped building the app. 

In spite of this, I did learn a fair bit of basic Objective C, and how to work in the XCode environment. 
Coming from a Python background, Objective C was quite a different language. I really enjoyed working with it,
as the lower level nature of the language allowed me to really get a feel of what was going on within the program.
Python's high level of abstraction allows for quick development, but a language like Objective C really forced me 
to 'know' my program. 

I also created data models for Study Buddy, which was the first time I had done so on my own. This was a big push 
for me to get familiar with how to build a NoSQL database, which data to capture and analyze, etc. 
I used Parse.com for the login, and password feature.

I think that this is a good idea for an app and it has potential. I would like to one day go back and finish it.
